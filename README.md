This repository is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding **bit-level operations** in programming.  
It includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that explain and demonstrate how bits work, how numbers are represented in binary, and how to perform bitwise operations efficiently.

---

## Overview

Bit manipulation is a powerful technique used in programming to perform operations directly on binary representations of data.  
It’s essential for optimizing code, working with hardware, cryptography, compression, and algorithms that require fast computations.

This repository covers the fundamental bitwise operations step by step, using simple examples and explanations.

## Repository Structure

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `1.Binary_Numbers.ipynb` | Introduction to binary number systems and their conversions. |
| `2.Bitwise_AND.ipynb` | Demonstrates the `AND` operation and its use in masking bits. |
| `3.Bitwise_OR.ipynb` | Covers the `OR` operation to set specific bits. |
| `4.Bitwise XOR (eXclusive OR).ipynb` | Explains the `XOR` operation and its role in toggling bits. |
| `5.Bitwise NOT.ipynb` | Shows the `NOT` operation and bitwise negation. |
| `6.Bit Shifting.ipynb` | Explains left and right shift operations and how they affect binary values. |
| `7.Integer_Overflow.ipynb` | Demonstrates how integer overflow happens at the bit level. |

---

## Learning Goals

By exploring these notebooks, you will learn to:
- Understand how data is represented in binary.
- Perform and visualize different bitwise operations.
- Use shifting and masking to manipulate bits.
- Recognize how integer overflow works in computer systems.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Recommended IDE: **VS Code** or **JupyterLab**

Install dependencies (if needed):
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

To run the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Additional Notes

Each notebook is designed to be **self-contained** and includes explanations, code examples, and outputs.
You can run the code cells interactively to understand how each bitwise operation behaves.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

After completing these notebooks, try:

* Solving bit manipulation problems on **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/bit-manipulation/)** or **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bitwise-operators-in-c/problem)**.
* Implementing algorithms that rely on bitwise logic (e.g., subset generation, parity checking, fast multiplication).
